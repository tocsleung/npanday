Supported Azure SDK Versions

    As of writing this, NPanday only supports version 1.6 of the Azure SDK (released in Sept 2011).

    In order to support further versions, they have to be defined here:
    {{{${project.scm.url}/src/main/resources/META-INF/npanday/executable-plugins.xml?view=markup}executable-plugins.xml}};
    feel free to {{{${project.issueManagement.url}}file an issue}}, if you need support for newer Azure versions here.

Changing the version in use

    If you need to change the version of the SDK used, configure <<<executableVersion>>> on the <<<azure-maven-plugin>>>,
    or override it through the commandline by using <<<-Dazuresdk.version=...>>>.
