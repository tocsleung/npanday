NPanday Azure Maven Plugin

   The Azure Plugin packages cloud services and it's corresponding web and worker roles
   for deployment onto the Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform. It gives you far more control over
   the build than Visual Studio does with its built-in tools, while it utilizes the same SDK
   features.

   It defines the packaging type <<<azure-cloud-service>>> and the corresponding lifecycle.

   The resulting artifact is a Cloud Service Package with file extension <<<*.cspkg>>>; it will further
   attach configured variants of Cloud Service Configurations (<<<*.cscfg>>>) which are required when
   deploying to the Azure Cloud.

   Have a look at the {{{./usage.html}usage documentation}} in order to find out how it can help you
   in your projects.
