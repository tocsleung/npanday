NPanday MSDeploy Maven Plugin

  The MSDeploy Maven Plugin is a wrapper for {{{http://www.iis.net/download/webdeploy}Microsoft Web Deploy}},
  also called MSDeploy. It picks up the collected package files (for example collected by
  {{{../aspnet-maven-plugin/index.html}aspnet-maven-plugin}}) and packs them to a zip (*.msdeploy.zip)
  or resolves and deploys other packages to arbitrary destinations, as for example IIS or plain folders on remote
  machines.

  It also allows executing commands on remote machines using the preSync and postSync events on the SyncMojo.

  Have a look at the {{{./usage.html}usage documentation}} in order to find out how to configure it for
  your project.
