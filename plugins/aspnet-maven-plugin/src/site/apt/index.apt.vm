NPanday ASP.NET Maven Plugin

  The ASP.NET Maven Plugin prepares a web package folder containing everything a web application needs to run.
  This can then be picked up by a succeeding plugin (for example the {{{../msdeploy-maven-plugin}msdeploy-maven-plugin}}
  for packaging.

  Have a look at the {{{./usage.html}usage documentation}} in order to find out how to configure it for
  your project.
