Using the NPanday Visual Studio Add-in

  By this point, you should have NPanday successfully installed as shown in the
  {{{../installation/index.html} Installation instructions}}, and have Visual Studio started with the NPanday Build Tool
  running.

  This guide will walk you through a basic introduction to the Visual Studio Add-in, how to use it for typical project
  tasks, and what configuration options are available.

  Finally, we will discuss the use cases where you might need to manipulate the Maven POM directly and other advanced
  use cases.

  After completing this guide, you may want to read the guide to
  {{{../devinfra/index.html} Using NPanday with your Maven Development Infrastructure}}.

  If you encounter any problems, don't forget to consult the
