Remote Repository Configuration

  A remote Maven repository can be configured using the Visual Studio IDE or it can be configured manually by adding
  information to the Maven settings file.
  
* Automatically Configure a Remote Maven Repository via the IDE

  To access a remote Maven repository you can configure it from within Visual Studio. Visual Studio must be open,
  the NPanday Build System must be running, and you must have a project loaded. Then:
  
      [[1]] Right-click on a project and select Add Maven Artifact... from the menu.

      [[2]] In the Add Maven Artifact pop-up window, click the Configure Repository tab.

      [[3]] Select the URL of the repository in the pop-up window.

      [[4]] If the remote repository allows snapshots or released artifacts to be stored there, then check the
            appropriate box.

      [[5]] Click Update. This will save the configuration to
            <<<C:\\Users\\[username]\\.m2\\settings.xml>>>. To edit multiple repositories, repeat
            steps 3 to 5 by selecting another repository to be configured form the drop down list.

      [[6]] Click Close when done configuring the repository.

[../../images/vs/remote_repo.jpg] Sample configuration for Remote Repository

  <<NOTE:>> The repository is stored in a profile NPanday.id this profile is then added into the activeProfiles list in
  <<<settings.xml>>> as soon as an NPanday remote repository is added. 
 
* Manually Configure a Remote Maven Repository

  To manually add a remote repository, add the following lines in your
  <<<C:\\Users\\[username]\\.m2\\settings.xml>>> file within the <<< \<profiles\> >>>
  <<< \</profiles\> >>> tag.  Modify the values for the <<< \<repository\> >>> and <<< \<id\> >>>elements
  with the repository url you want to access.

+------+
<profile>
  <activation>
    <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
  </activation>
  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <releases>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
      </releases>
      <snapshots>
        <enabled>false</enabled>
      </snapshots>
      <id>http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/</id>
      <url>http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/</url>
    </repository>
  </repositories>
  <id>NPanday.id</id>
</profile>
+------+

  You should change the values of <<<enabled>>> for each of the artifact types, dependencing on whether the
  repository contains that type of version.

* Summary

  The next configuration options are the {{{./settings.html} Maven settings}} themselves. You can also return to the
  {{{./index.html} index}}.
