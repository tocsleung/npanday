Web References

  Web references are artifacts that refer to the web service. These are usually in web format.
  
  The following procedures in adding, renaming, and deleting web references assumes that the project in which the web
  references will be added, renamed, or deleted has an existing <<<pom.xml>>> file from a previous import. Executing the
  following procedures will also make changes to the <<<pom.xml>>> file of the project.

  Luckily these procedures are identical to normal Visual Studio development.

* Adding Web References

      [[1]] Right click on the project that you want to add a web reference to.

      [[2]] Select Add Web Reference... from the menu list.

      [[3]] Select the web service you want to add, or you can choose to type the URL.

      [[4]] Supply a Name for the reference. This will be used to call the reference later in your code.

* Renaming Web References

      [[1]] Right click on the web reference of the project application that you want to rename. Or, right click on the folder containing the
      wsdl file of the web service of the web project that you want to rename.

      [[2]] Select Rename.

      [[3]] Supply the new Name for the reference. This will be used to call the reference later in your code.

* Removing Web References

      [[1]] Right click on the web reference of the project application that you want to delete. Or, right click on the folder where
      the wsdl file of the web service of the web project that you want to delete.

      [[2]] Select Delete.

* Summary

  As you can see, working with web references is very familiar - all of the procedures are the same, with the
  <<<pom.xml>>> changes handled by NPanday behind the scenes. You may, out of interest, want to review the POM after
  the addition of a web reference.

  Having understood references, the next topic is maintaining them across different checkouts in the document
  {{{./resyncReferences.html} making project files portable}}. You can also return to the {{{./index.html} index}}.
