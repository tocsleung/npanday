Uninstalling NPanday

  To remove the NPanday follow these steps:

  [[1]] Run the uninstaller from the Control Panel's Add/Remove programs dialog if you used the MSI to install NPanday.
  
  [[2]] Clear the cache by typing the following in a command shell:
  
  <<<%ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\\SDK\\v2.0\\Bin\\mscorcfg.msc>>>
  
  other possible locations for mscorcfg.msc
  
  <<<%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322\mscorcfg.msc>>>
  
  <<<%windir%\ServicePackFiles\i386\mscorcfg.msc>>>
  
  <<<%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\Bin\mscorcfg.msc>>>
  
  [[3]] Go to My Computer > AssemblyCache, click View List. Delete the following two files:
  
          * <<<Npanday.Model.Pom>>>

          * <<<NPanday.Plugin>>>

          []

  [[4]] Remove the following file <<<C:\\Users\\[username]\\.m2\\npanday-settings.xml>>>
  
  []
  
  An alternative to step 3 is to run the following commands from the command prompt as an administrator:

----
gacutil /u NPanday.Model.Pom
gacutil /u NPanday.Plugin
----

Uninstalling without the Installer

  If you didn't use the installer package to install NPanday, you should still perform step 2 onwards above, and then the
  following additional steps:
  
  [[1]] Locate and delete your previous version of the NPanday .NET Build Tool for Visual Studio.
  It is typically found at the following location, where [username] is
  replaced with the local username.
  
  <<<C:\\Users\\[username]\\My Documents\\Visual Studio 2005\\Addins\\NPanday.VisualStudio.AddIn>>>

  Also delete the Addin-file in corresponding folders for other versions of
  Visual Studio.

  [[2]] Remove the <<<C:\\Users\\[username]\\.m2\\repository\\org\\apache\\npanday>>> directory

  []
